## Purpose
This repository documents my learning journey in the course *AI for the Arts and Humanities*. It includes Python exercises, multimedia integration, and critical reflections on AI's social and cultural implications.

---

## Contents
- **coding_exercises.ipynb**  
  - Basic Python concepts: printing, variables, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries.
  - Multimedia integration: embedded YouTube video, images, and audio using IPython.display.
  - Algorithm → Pseudocode → Python code exercises.
  - **Scikit-Learn datasets exploration**: loading and analyzing datasets using `sklearn.datasets`.
  - **Pandas exploration**: working with DataFrames for structured data analysis.

- **Machine-Learning-by-Example-from-Start-to-End.ipynb**
  ### This notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using two datasets:
  - **California Housing Data**: Predict median housing prices using linear regression.
  - **MNIST Image Data**: Classify handwritten digits using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
  ### The notebook is designed for educational purposes
  - Understand the workflow and reflect on problem framing.
  - Download and explore datasets.
  - Prepare data (handle missing values, scaling, stratified sampling).
  - Train models (Linear Regression and CNN).
  - Reflect on the process and experiment with TensorFlow Playground.
  ### Requirements
  To run this notebook, ensure your environment includes:
  - Python ≥ 3.7
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, `keras`

- **Media files**  
  Images and audio used in the notebook to enhance engagement.

## Learning Goals
### By working through these notebooks, you will:
- Understand basic Python programming concepts (variables, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries).
- Learn how to integrate multimedia (YouTube videos, images, audio) into Jupyter notebooks using `IPython.display`.
- Practice converting algorithms from pseudocode to Python code.
- Gain hands-on experience with **Scikit-Learn** and **Pandas** for data analysis.
- Gain a complete understanding of the machine learning workflow （problem farming, data preparation, model training, evaluation）
- Critically reflect on AI and machine learning for arts and humanities.
