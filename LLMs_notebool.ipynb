    "## 1. Background on Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a major advancement in natural language processing. They are trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text, enabling applications in education, creativity, and cultural engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Common Ways to Use LLMs\n",
    "1. **Through an API**  \n",
    "   - Example: OpenAI’s GPT-4 API or HuggingFace’s model endpoints.  \n",
    "   - Requires coding skills and often incurs costs.  \n",
    "   - Tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, or Gemini integrate LLMs into user-friendly interfaces.\n",
    "   - No coding required, but limited customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standalone Executable Models**  \n",
    "   - Example: Llamafile or Ollama, which allow running models locally.\n",
    "   - Useful for privacy and offline use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community Platforms**  \n",
    "   - [HuggingFace Spaces]ready-to-use demos and collaborative environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Key Considerations\n",
    "- **Data Privacy**  \n",
    "  It’s unclear how services like ChatGPT handle user data. Transparency is limited.  \n",
    "- **Model Size vs. Efficiency**:Bigger models are not always better. Initiatives like \n",

    "### 1.3 Why this Matters for Design?\n",
    "Understanding these aspects helps you design an application that:\n",
    "- Leverages LLM capabilities effectively.\n",
    "- Addresses ethical concerns (privacy, bias).\n",
    "- Promotes inclusivity and cultural diversity.\n"

    "# 2.Application design： e.g. Historical story generator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The proposed application uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate historically inspired narratives based on user-selected cultures, time periods, and themes. The goal is to **promote cultural diversity, historical awareness, and ethical storytelling** while mitigating bias and ensuring inclusivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience\n",
    "- **Educators and Students**: For history and cultural studies.\n",
    "- **Writers and Artists**: Seeking inspiration for creative projects.\n",
    "- **Community Organizations**: Preserving local traditions and oral histories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Features\n",
    "- **Culturally Sensitive Story Generation**: Users input a historical period and cultural context (e.g., \"World War II in Germany\"). The LLM generates a narrative that avoids stereotypes and reflects authentic cultural values.\n",
    "- **Language Support**: Stories can be generated in multiple languages.\n",
    "- **Educational Mode**: Provides historical context alongside generated stories, encouraging critical thinking rather than passive consumption.\n",

    "- 2. Choose language & tone\n",

    "# 4. Critical reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs offer transformative potential, their design and deployment raise critical ethical and social questions. Below are key concerns supported by recent research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Cultural Bias in Model Outputs\n",
    "LLMs often reflect dominant cultural norms embedded in their training data, which can marginalize underrepresented communities.  \n",
    "> *“We find that the five GPT models’ outputs exhibit a cultural bias towards self-expression values, which include environmental protection and tolerance of diversity, foreigners, gender equality, and different sexual orientations. This cultural bias is remarkably consistent across the five models.”*  \n",
    "— [PNAS Nexus, 2024](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/9/pgae346/7756548)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Implication:** Incorporate cultural prompting and diverse datasets to reduce bias and promote inclusivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Educational Impact and Critical Thinking\n",
    "Over-reliance on LLMs for programming tasks may undermine students’ problem-solving skills.  \n",
    "> *“The significant inverse correlation associated with code generation and debugging suggests that reliance on LLMs for these critical thinking-intensive activities could be detrimental to students’ ability to independently solve programming tasks. This might imply that while LLMs can be a valuable resource for learning and problem-solving, their use needs to be balanced with the development of independent coding skills.”*  \n",
    "— [MDPI Applied Sciences, 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/10/4115)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Implication:** Position AI as a supportive tool, not a substitute for cognitive effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Social Justice and Inclusive Design\n",
    "Data quality and design choices directly affect fairness and equity in AI systems.  \n",
    "> *“Data underlying AI-based technology heavily influences the technology’s quality towards fair decision-making. Compiling data sets from binary, superficial categories without considering the complexity in experiences can thus lead to injustice. From a perspective of social justice, technology design should be inspired by a concern for ethical and social issues such as supporting well-being and reducing inequalities. This requires working in real partnership with local communities and marginalised groups to understand and tackle injustice.”*  \n",
